     <p>
    I currently live in Vista, CA but have lived in most every part of San Diego county and have been to half the states in the US. It started in the midwest, however. I attended college in Bismarck, ND and completed my degree at Cal State University San Marcos. In 2011, I received a BA in Literature and Writing,with an emphasis in Literature. 
    </p>
    <p>My initial goal was to become an educator, but after transferring colleges, dealing with California's budget crisis, and waiting seven years to get my degree, I was eager to get my life started</p>
    <p>I stumbled backwards into a career in search engine optimization, SEO copy writing, and digital marketing, but I still have a passion and interest in doing something for the better good. I hope to utilze my web development skills for a public institution.</p>
